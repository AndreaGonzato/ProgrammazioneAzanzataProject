# server-java-multi-client
This is my final project for my exam of "Advanced Programming".
The project is a Java server that handle multi clients. 
This server responds to some mathematical request like min or max of a function. 
For a better understanding of the protocol and project specifications read the [specs](roject_specifications.pdf).
